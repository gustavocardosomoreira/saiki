# Plan: LLM-Powered Document Structure Analyzer (GitHub-Native)

## Goal
Develop an application that analyzes multiple documents to identify their common textual structure, leveraging LLMs. The application will be developed and run entirely within the GitHub ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Document Ingestion:** Ability to ingest multiple documents from the repository.
- **Structure Extraction:** Use an LLM to extract the textual structure from each document.
- **Common Structure Identification:** Identify the common structure across all documents.
- **Template Comparison:** Compare the extracted structure with a provided template file.
- **GitHub Integration:** Seamless integration with GitHub for development, execution, and deployment.

## Development Environment
- **GitHub Codespaces:** Use GitHub Codespaces for the development environment. This eliminates the need for local setup and provides a consistent environment for all contributors.

## Technologies
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **LLM Library:** `transformers` or similar for LLM interaction.
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating tasks such as testing, linting, and deployment.
- **GitHub Pages (Optional):** If a UI is needed, GitHub Pages can be used to host it.

## Development Steps

1.  **Project Setup:**
    -   Create a new branch for development.
    -   Set up the basic project structure in the repository.
    -   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies.

2.  **Document Ingestion:**
    -   Implement functionality to read documents from the repository.
    -   Support various document formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`).

3.  **Structure Extraction:**
    -   Implement LLM-based structure extraction from individual documents.
    -   Fine-tune the LLM if necessary for better accuracy.

4.  **Common Structure Identification:**
    -   Develop an algorithm to identify the common structure across multiple documents.
    -   Consider using techniques like sequence alignment or graph matching.

5.  **Template Comparison:**
    -   Implement functionality to compare the extracted structure with the provided template file.
    -   Highlight differences and similarities.

6.  **Testing and Validation:**
    -   Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.
    -   Use GitHub Actions to automate testing on each commit.

7.  **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    -   Set up GitHub Actions for:
        -   Linting (e.g., using `flake8`).
        -   Testing.
        -   Deployment (if using GitHub Pages).

8.  **User Interface (Optional):**
    -   If a user interface is needed, develop a simple UI using a framework like Flask or Streamlit.
    -   Host the UI on GitHub Pages.

9.  **Documentation:**
    -   Write clear and concise documentation for the application.
    -   Include instructions on how to use the application and how to contribute to the project.

10. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    -   Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Branching Strategy
-   `main`: Stable, production-ready code.
-   `develop`: Integration branch for new features.
-   Feature branches: For individual feature development, branched from `develop`.

## Commit Message Guidelines
-   Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
-   Follow a consistent commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits).

## Collaboration
-   Use pull requests for code review and collaboration.
-   Assign reviewers to pull requests to ensure code quality.
